            <span>Currently, I am a web designer at Super Purposes. I develop web pages using 
the WIX platform. In my free time, I enjoy developing my own web pages using 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
			
			
			
I also volunteer as a graphic designer for a non-profit organization, Eternal Light.
I create social media posts and flyers gathering awareness about upcoming events.
These events, like food drives or tournaments, help gather donations for Eternal Light.
It is a wonderful feeling to be able to bring light to the multitude of options for those in need.
			
			
			
I am a part of a mentor collective community where we offer advice to upcoming freshmen
at our university. Advice can range from different clubs to join to major changes,
whatever the question is, we try our best to support the mentee. It is very fulfilling to pass
on my knowledge to try and help those who are uncertain about their path!</span>
